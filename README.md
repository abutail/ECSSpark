# ECSSpark
Fargate
This an example that creates an ECS task to run a Spark application and automatically scales based on the number of messages in an Amazon SQS queue. I’ll provide a detailed walkthrough including the code for a simple Spark application.

Step 1: Spark Application

Create a simple Spark application that processes messages from SQS. Here’s an example in Scala:

import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

object SimpleApp {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Simple Application").getOrCreate()
    // Code to process messages from the SQS queue
    spark.stop()
  }
}

Step 2: Dockerize the Spark Application

Create a Dockerfile for your Spark application:

FROM apache/spark:3.1.2
COPY target/scala-2.12/simple-app_2.12-1.0.jar /app/simple-app.jar
CMD ["spark-submit", "--class", "SimpleApp", "/app/simple-app.jar"]

Build and push the Docker image to Amazon ECR:

docker build -t simple-spark-app .
aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
docker tag simple-spark-app:latest <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/simple-spark-app:latest
docker push <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/simple-spark-app:latest

Step 3: Create Task Definition in ECS

Create a task definition in ECS with the container image from Step 2.

Step 4: Create an ECS Service

Create an ECS service using the task definition, and configure it with your desired task count, VPC, subnets, and security groups.

Step 5: Create CloudWatch Alarm for SQS Queue

Create an alarm in CloudWatch to monitor the ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible metric of your SQS queue. Set the threshold based on the number of messages that should trigger scaling.

Step 6: Create AWS Auto Scaling Policy

In your ECS service, add a target tracking scaling policy. Choose a custom metric using the CloudWatch alarm created in Step 5. Set your target value and cooldown periods as needed.

Step 7: Test the Scaling Configuration

Simulate different load patterns by adding and removing messages from the SQS queue. Monitor how the ECS service responds and scales the Spark tasks based on the queue size.

This example demonstrates how to create and scale a Spark application running in AWS Fargate based on the number of messages in an Amazon SQS queue. It includes creating a Spark application, Dockerizing it, setting up the ECS task definition and service, creating a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the SQS queue, and configuring an auto-scaling policy to adjust the number of Spark tasks based on the queue size.

Please note that additional considerations, such as IAM permissions, error handling, and optimizations, may be necessary for a production-ready deployment. Always refer to the official AWS and Apache Spark documentation for comprehensive guidance.
